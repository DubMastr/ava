============

Case Studies and Research Organisations
---------------------------------------

We need to scale AVA and find test sets that are representative of the organisations who would benefit most from this tool.

This is not something we can make up or simulate.

We are looking for international organisations of all shapes and sizes to help us map and model people structures.

* Help provided.
* Scripts available.
* All industries and sectors.
* No such thing as too big.
* Data sharing safety and privacy an absolute priority.

If you would like your organisation to be at the leading edge of understanding your human security risk. Get in touch!

Research Papers and Student Projects
------------------------------------

Are you a student or academic with an interest in sociology, identity or security?

We are actively seeking interested people to undertake or collaborate on human-centric security research topics.

Areas of interest:

* Community and trust structures within organisations
* Power dynamics, hierarchy and security risk
* Propagation of risk behaviours through connected groups
* Visualisation and communication of security advice and education for non-technical audiences

Ethics and Privacy Board
------------------------
AVA is a challenging tool. It has many features (built and planned) that are unconventional and if poorly thought out could pose a serious risk to the privacy and safety of people.

To help keep us on track, ethical and privacy focused we have formed an Ethics and Privacy board.

This board aims to be:

* Objective
* Representative
* Independent
* Collaborative

We openly invite people from all walks of life and experience to join us. We hope to find a diverse and representative group to provide scrutiny to the AVA project.

The role of the board is to:
* Question approaches
* Suggest unexpected or unintended privacy concerns
* Provide guidance as to community concerns

We want to be challenged. We want to be ethical and respect our users whilst improving their security behaviours.

This is an unpaid board with a low-impact online community approach. If you would like to know more, get in touch.
