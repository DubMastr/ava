    <p>This is just a placeholder</p>

    <p>Go to <a href="{% url 'google-auth-login-redirect' %}">{% url 'google-auth-login-redirect' %}</a> to trigger the login
    process.</p>

    <p>Once that's done, you can go to <a href="{% url 'google-retrieve-info' %}">{% url 'google-retrieve-info' %}
      </a> to try and actually so something interesting with the
      data, but that's as far as I was able to get without having data to retrieve.</p>
