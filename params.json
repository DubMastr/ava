{"name":"AVA","tagline":"Protect your people","body":"\r\n\r\n> Visit our homepage at [http://avasecure.com](http://avasecure.com)\r\n\r\n### We build secure people\r\nInformation security is often misunderstood. Most people believe that if you throw enough gadgets at an organisation you will mitigate any potential vulnerability. Technology is only a fraction of the picture.\r\nInformation security is at its heart a human problem. Wherever there exists choice, there is risk. \r\n\r\n> We specialise in the **Assessment**, **Visualization** and **Analysis** of human organisational information security risk.\r\n\r\nAVA maps the realities of your organisation, its structures and behaviors. This map of people and interconnected entities can then be tested using a unique suite of customisable on-demand and scheduled information security awareness tests. \r\n\r\nThe results of this combine into a detailed risk profile of your organisation unlike any other tool can provide - from the people up. A diverse set of analysis and visualization tools can then be employed to predict departments, locations and people who pose the most risk allowing limited educational and defensive budgets to be used where they are most needed.\r\n\r\nAVA Secure puts the people first in security assessment, leaving your organisation - visibly more secure.\r\n\r\n### License and Open sourcing\r\nWe believe that security tools based on secret recipes are dangerous. Security solutions should always be subject to scrutiny. Open sourcing AVA allows us to be seen and for collaborators to get involved. Only together can we make AVA the best first step to protecting your people.\r\n\r\nAVA is released under GPL v2. If you aren't sure what this means then you should probably read this -http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html.\r\nIf the terms of GPL are not suitable to your environment, please get in touch. We would be happy to discuss this with you.\r\n\r\nEventually there may be paid services or componants based around AVA. The core will always remain free and open source for those who want to run it internally.\r\n\r\nThe AVA core code base will become open source and public at the end of March 2015.\r\n\r\n### AVA is looking for collaborators\r\nWe are on the look out for testers, django/python developers and UX people to help make AVA awesome. If you have some spare cycles and want to contribute.
