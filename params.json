{"name":"AVA","tagline":"Visibly more secure","body":"### We build secure people\r\nInformation security is often misunderstood. Most people believe that if you throw enough gadgets at an organisation you will mitigate any potential vulnerability. Technology is only a fraction of the picture.\r\nInformation security is at its heart a human problem. Wherever there exists choice, there is risk. \r\n\r\n> We specialise in the **Assessment**, **Visualization** and **Analysis** of human organisational information security risk.\r\n\r\nAVA maps the realities of your organisation, its structures and behaviors. This map of people and interconnected entities can then be tested using a unique suite of customisable on-demand and scheduled information security awareness tests. \r\n\r\nThe results of this combine into a detailed risk profile of your organisation unlike any other tool can provide - from the people up. A diverse set of analysis and visualization tools can then be employed to predict departments, locations and people who pose the most risk allowing limited educational and defensive budgets to be used where they are most needed.\r\n\r\nAVA Secure puts the people first in security assessment, leaving your organisation - visibly more secure.\r\n\r\n### AVA is looking for collaborators\r\nWe are on the look out for testers, django/python developers and UX people to help make AVA awesome. If you have some spare cycles and want to contribute. Email : contribute@avasecure.com with details of your skills and availablity.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAVA is the work of Laura Bell (@lady_nerd on Twitter) and her company, SafeStack - a specialist New Zealand based application security firm.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
